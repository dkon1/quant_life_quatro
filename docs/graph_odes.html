<p>I find the great thing in this world is not so much where we stand, as in what direction we are moving.<br>
– Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., <em>The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the last chapter we considered discrete time models, in which time is counted in integers. This worked well to describe processes that happen in periodic cycles, like cell division or heart pumping. Many biological systems do not work this way. Change can happen continuously, that is, at any moment in time. For instance, the concentration of a biological molecule in the cell changes gradually, as does the voltage across the cell membrane in a neuron.</p>
<p>The models for continuously changing variables require their own set of mathematical tools. Instead of difference equations, we are going to see our first differential equations, which use derivatives to describe how a variable changes with time. There is a tremendous amount of knowledge accumulated by mathematicians, physicists and engineers for analyzing and solving differential equations. There are many classes of differential equations for which it is possible to find analytic solutions, often in the form of so-called special functions. Differential equations courses for physicists and engineers are typically focused on learning about the variety of existing tools for solving a few types of differential equations. For the purposes of biological modeling, knowing how to solve a limited number of differential equations is of limited usefulness. We will instead focus on learning how to analyze the behavior of differential equations in general, without having to solve them on paper.</p>
<p>In this chapter you will learn to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>build differential equations based on stated assumptions</p></li>
<li><p>find equilibrium values of an ODE</p></li>
<li><p>analyze the stability of equilibria based on the graph of the defining function</p></li>
<li><p>write down stability conditions analytically</p></li>
<li><p>use graphical techniques to predict the behavior of the solution of a differential equation without solving it</p></li>
<li><p>understand basic compartment epidemiology models</p></li>

<h3 data-number="10.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-discrete-time-to-continuous"><span class="header-section-number">10.1.1</span> from discrete time to continuous</h3>
<p>In this chapter we investigate <em>continuous time dynamical systems</em>, for which it does not make sense to break time up into equal intervals. Instead of equations describing the increments in the dependent variable from one time step to the next, we will see equations with the instantaneous rate of the change (derivative) of the variable. Let us see the connection between the discrete and continuous dynamic models by reducing the step size of the bacteria-division population model.</p>
<p>First, suppose that instead of dividing every hour, the population of bacteria divide every half-hour, but only half of the population does. That half is chosen randomly, so we don’t have to keep track of whether each bacterium divided the last time around or not. Therefore, each half-hour exactly half of the population is added to the current population: <span class="math display">\[ N(t+0.5) = N(t) + 0.5N(t) = 1.5N(t)\]</span> The solution for this model can be figured out from the linear difference equation solution we derived in section <span class="math inline">\(\ref{sec:math14}\)</span> Every half-hour, the population is multiplied by 1.5, so we can write: <span class="math display">\[ N(t) = 1.5^{2t} N(0) = (1.5^2)^t N(0)\]</span> Compare this solution with the one for the every-hour model, <span class="math inline">\(N(t) = 2^t N(0)\)</span> by plugging in a few numbers for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. The half-hour model grows faster, because it has the base of 2.25 instead of 2.</p>
<p>Now, suppose that the bacteria can divide four times an hour, but only a quarter of the population reproduces at any given time. The model can be written similarly: <span class="math display">\[N(t+0.25) = N(t) + 0.25N(t) = 1.25N(t)\]</span> The solution for this model is once again exponential, with the difference that each half contains 4 division events: <span class="math display">\[N(t) = 1.25^{4t}N(0) = (1.25^4)^t N(0)\]</span> This solution has the exponential base is <span class="math inline">\(1.25^4\)</span>, which is larger than <span class="math inline">\(1.5^2\)</span>. So what happens when we take this further?</p>
<p>Suppose the bacteria divide <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> times an hour, with time step <span class="math inline">\(1/m\)</span>. Then extending our models above, we can write down the model and the solution: <span class="math display">\[ N(t + 1/m) = N(t) + 1/m N(t) = (1+1/m) N(t) \]</span> <span class="math display">\[ N(t) = (1+1/m)^{mt} N(0) = [(1+1/m)^m]^t N(0)\]</span></p>
<p>Now we can do what mathematicians enjoy the most: take things to the limit. What if <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> were 100? A million? A gazillion? Let us re-write the model equation: <span class="math display">\[ N(t+1/m) - N(t) = 1/m N(t) \Rightarrow \frac{N(t+1/m) - N(t) }{1/m} = N(t)\]</span></p>
<p>The expression on the left is known as Newton’s quotient that you encounter in the definition of a derivative. It measures the rate of change of the population <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> from some time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> to the next time step <span class="math inline">\(t+1/m\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is increased to make the time step smaller, this makes both the numerator and the denominator smaller, and the quotient approaches the <em>instantaneous rate of change</em> of <span class="math inline">\(N(t)\)</span>. So, if bacteria divide at any point in time, with the , the model becomes a differential equation: <span class="math display">\[ \frac{dN}{dt} = N(t)\]</span></p>
<p>We can do a similar procedure to the formula of the solution of the model. The dependence on <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is all on the left-hand side, in the expression <span class="math inline">\((1+1/m)^m\)</span>, which is the base of the exponential function. What happens to this number as <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> becomes larger? Does it increase without bound? You can investigate this numerically by plugging in progressively larger numbers <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, and see that the number approaches a specific value: 2.71828… This is the special constant <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, called the base of the natural logarithm. So, if bacteria divide at any point in time, with the <strong>average rate of 1 per hour</strong>, the solution of the model becomes: <span class="math display">\[ N(t) = e^t N(0)\]</span></p>

<p>Here we will explore the effect of changing the step size on the solution of a discrete time dynamic model. We will use a very simple model of bacterial population growth, in which we assume that bacteria divide once an hour and there are no deaths.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Calculate the solution for this population, assuming that all bacteria divide exactly once an hour - in other words, a birth rate of one per individual. Starting with one bacterium use a for loop to calculate the solution for 10 hours and print out the last value.</li>

<p>We will now build some common differential equations models. First, a simple population growth model with a constant growth rate. Suppose that in a population each individual reproduces with the average reproductive rate <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. This is reflected in the following differential equation: <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\frac{d x} {dt} = \dot x = r x
\label{eq:linear_ode}
\end{equation}\]</span> This expression states that the rate of change of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, which we take to be population size, is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> with multiplicative constant <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. We will sometimes use the notation <span class="math inline">\(\dot x\)</span> for the time derivative of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (which was invented by Newton) for aesthetic reasons.</p>
<p>First, we apply dimensional analysis to this model. The units of the derivative are population per time, as can be deduced from the Newton’s quotient definition. Thus, the units in the equation have the following relationship: <span class="math display">\[ \frac{[population]}{[time]} = [r] [population] = \frac{1}{[time]}[population] \]</span> This shows that as in the discrete time models, the dimension of the population growth rate <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is inverse time, or frequency. The difference with the discrete time population models lies in the time scope of the rate. In the case of the difference equation, <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the rate of change per one time step of the model. In the differential equation, <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the <em>instantaneous rate of population growth</em>. It is less intuitive than the growth rate per single reproductive cycle, just like the slope of a curve is less intuitive than the slope of a line. The population growth happens continuously, so the growth rate of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> individuals per year does not mean that if we start with one individual, there will be <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> after one year. In order to make quantitative predictions, we need to find the solution of the equation, which we will see in the next section.</p>

<p>Reactions between molecules in cells occur continuously, driven by molecular collisions and physical forces. In order to model this complex behavior, it is generally assumed that reactions occur with a particular speed, known as the <em>kinetic rate constant</em>. As mentioned in chapter 2, a simple reaction of conversion from one type of molecule (<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>) to another (<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>) can be written as follows: <span class="math display">\[ A \xrightarrow{k} B \]</span> In this equation the parameter <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the kinetic rate rate constant, describing the speed of conversion of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, per concentration of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>Chemists and biochemists use differential equations to describe the change in molecular concentration during a reaction. These equations are known as the <em>laws of mass action</em>. For the reaction above, the concentration of molecule <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> decreases continuously proportionally to itself, and the concentration of molecule <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> increases continuously proportionally to the concentration of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. This is expressed by the following two differential equations: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:lin_chem_kin}
\dot A &amp;=&amp; - k A \\
\dot B &amp;=&amp; kA
\end{eqnarray}\]</span></p>
<p>Several conclusions are apparent by inspection of the equations. First, the dynamics depend only on the concentration of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, so keeping track of the concentration of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is superfluous. The second observation reinforces the first: the sum of the concentrations of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is constant. This is mathematically demonstrated by adding the two equations together to obtain the following: <span class="math display">\[ \dot A + \dot B = -kA + kA = 0\]</span> One of the basic properties of the derivative is that the sum of derivatives is the same as the derivative of the sum: <span class="math display">\[\dot A + \dot B = \frac{d(A+B)}{dt} = 0\]</span></p>
<p>This means that the sum of the concentrations of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is a constant. This is a mathematical expression of the law of conservation in chemistry: molecules can change from one type to another, but they cannot appear or disappear in other ways. In this case, a single molecule of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> becomes a single molecule of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, so it follows that the sum of the two has to remain the same. If the reaction were instead two molecules of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> converting to a molecule of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, then the conserved quantity is <span class="math inline">\(2A + B\)</span>. The concept of conserved quantity is very useful for the analysis of differential equations. We will see in later chapters how it can help us find solutions, and explain the behavior of complex dynamical systems.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The simple, linear population growth models we have seen in the last two chapters assume that the per capita birth and death rates are constant, that is, they stay the same regardless of population size. The solutions for these models either grow or decay exponentially, but in reality, populations do not grow without bounds. It is generally true that the larger a population grows, the more scarce the resources, and survival becomes more difficult. For larger populations, this could lead to higher death rates, or lower birth rates, or both.</p>
<p>How can we incorporate this effect into a quantitative model? We will assume there are separate birth and death rates, and that the birth rate declines as the population grows, while the death rate increases. Suppose there are inherent birth rates <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, and the overall birth and death rates <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> depend linearly on population size <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(B = b - aP\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D = d + cP\)</span>.</p>
<p>To model the rate of change of the population, we need to multiply the rates <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> by the population size <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, since each individual can reproduce or die. Also, since the death rate <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> decreases the population, we need to put a negative sign on it. The resulting model is: <span class="math display">\[ \dot P = BP - DP = [(b-d)-(a+c)P]P \]</span></p>
<p>The parameters of the model, the constants <span class="math inline">\(a,b,c,d\)</span>, have different meanings. Performing dimensional analysis, we find that <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> have the dimensions of <span class="math inline">\(1/[t]\)</span>, the same as the rate <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> in the exponential growth model. However, the dimensions of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> (and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>) must obey the relation: <span class="math inline">\([P]/[t] = [a][P]^2\)</span>, and thus,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[[a]=[c] = \frac{1}{[t][P]}\]</span></p>
<p>This shows that the constants <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> have to be treated differently than <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. Let us define the inherent growth rate of the population, to be <span class="math inline">\(r_0=b-d\)</span> (if the death rate is greater than the birth rate, the population will inherently decline). Then let us introduce another constant <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\((a+c)=r_0/K\)</span>. It should be clear from the dimensional analysis that <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> has units of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, population size. Now we can write down the logistic equation in the canonical form: <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\dot P = r\left(1-\frac{P}{K}\right)P
\label{eq:log_cont_model}
\end{equation}\]</span> This model can be re-written as <span class="math inline">\(\dot P = aP -bP^2\)</span>, so it is clear that there is a <em>linear term</em> (<span class="math inline">\(aP\)</span>) and a <em>nonlinear term</em> (<span class="math inline">\(-bP^2\)</span>). When <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is sufficiently small (and positive) the linear term is greater, and the population grows. When <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is large enough, the nonlinear term wins and the population declines. </p>
<p>It should be apparent that there are two fixed points, at <span class="math inline">\(P=0\)</span> and at <span class="math inline">\(P=K\)</span>. The first one corresponds to a population with no individuals. On the other hand, <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> signifies the population at which the negative effect of population size balances out the inherent population growth rate, and is called the <em>carrying capacity</em> of a population in its environment . We will analyze the qualitative behavior of the solution, without writing it down, in the next section of this chapter.</p>

<p>In this section we will analyze the behavior of solutions of an autonomous ODE without solving it on paper. Generally, ODE models for realistic biological systems are nonlinear, and most nonlinear differential equations cannot be solved analytically. We can make predictions about the behavior, or <em>dynamics</em> of solutions by considering the properties of the <em>defining function</em>, which is the function on the right-hand-side of a general autonomous ODE: <span class="math display">\[ \frac{dx}{dt} = f(x)\]</span></p>
<section id="graphical-analysis-of-the-defining-function" class="level3" data-number="10.2.1">
<h3 data-number="10.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="graphical-analysis-of-the-defining-function"><span class="header-section-number">10.2.1</span> graphical analysis of the defining function</h3>
<p>The defining function relates the value of the solution variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to its rate of change <span class="math inline">\(dx/dt\)</span>. For different values of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, the rate of change of <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> is different, and it is defined by the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. There are only three options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>if <span class="math inline">\(f(x) &gt; 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> is increasing at that value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>if <span class="math inline">\(f(x) &lt; 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> is decreasing at that value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>if <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> is not changing that value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>To determine for which values of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> the solution <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> increases and decreases, it enough to look at the plot of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. On the intervals where the graph of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is above the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> increases, on the intervals where the graph of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is below the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis, <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> decreases. The roots (zeros) of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> are special cases, they separate the range of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> into the intervals where the solution grows and and where it decreases. This seems exceedingly simple, and it is, but it provides specific information about <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span>, without knowing how to write down its formula.</p>
<p>For an autonomous ODE with one dependent variable, the direction of the rate of change prescribed by the differential equation can be graphically represented by sketching the <em>flow on the line</em> of the dependent variable. The flow stands for the direction of change at every point, specifically increasing, decreasing, or not changing. The flow is plotted on the horizontal x-axis, so if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is increasing, the flow will be indicated by a rightward arrow, and if it is decreasing, the flow will point to the left. The fixed points separate the regions of increasing (rightward) flow and decreasing (leftward) flow.</p>

<p><strong>Example.</strong> Consider a linear ODE the likes of which we have solved in section <span class="math inline">\(\ref{sec:math15}\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\frac{dx}{dt} = 4x -100\]</span> The defining function is a straight line vs.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, its graph is shown in figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:ch16_flow_linear}\)</span>a. Based on this graph, we conclude that the solution decreases when <span class="math inline">\(x&lt;25\)</span> and increases when <span class="math inline">\(x&gt;25\)</span>. Thus we can sketch the solution <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> over time, without knowing its functional form. The dynamics depends on the initial value: if <span class="math inline">\(x(0)&lt;25\)</span>, the solution will keep decreasing without bound, and go off to negative infinity; if <span class="math inline">\(x(0)&gt;25\)</span>, the solution will keep decreasing without bound, and go off to positive infinity. This is shown by plotting numeric solutions of this ODE for several initial values in figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:ch16_flow_linear}\)</span>b. The dotted line shows the location of the special value of 25 which separates the interval of growth from the interval of decline.</p>
<p><strong>Example.</strong> Now let us analyze a nonlinear ODE, specifically the logistic model with the following parameters: <span class="math display">\[\frac{dP}{dt} =0.3P\left(1-\frac{P}{40}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>The defining function is a downward-facing parabola with two roots at <span class="math inline">\(P=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P=40\)</span>, as shown in figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:ch16_flow_logistic}\)</span>a. Between the two roots, the defining function is positive, which means the derivative <span class="math inline">\(dP/dt\)</span> is positive too, so the solution grows on that interval. For <span class="math inline">\(P&lt;0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P&gt;40\)</span>, the solution decreases. Therefore, we can sketch the graphs of the solution <span class="math inline">\(P(t)\)</span> starting with different initial conditions, as show in figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:ch16_flow_logistic}\)</span>b.</p>
<p>To summarize, the defining function of the ODE determines the rate of change of the solution <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> depending on the value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. The graphical approach to finding areas of right and left flow is based on graphing the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, and dividing the x-axis based on the sign of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. In the areas where <span class="math inline">\(f(x) &gt; 0\)</span>, its graph is above the x-axis, and the flow is to the right; conversely, when <span class="math inline">\(f(x) &lt; 0\)</span>, its graph is below the x-axis, and the flow is to the left. The next subsection puts this approach in a more analytic framework.</p>

<p>We have seen that the dynamics of solutions of differential equations depend on the initial value of the dependent variable: for some values the solution increases, for others it decreases, and for intermediate values it remains the same. Those special values separating intervals of increase and decrease are called fixed points (or equilibria), and the first step to understanding the dynamics of an ODE is finding its fixed points. A fixed point is a value of the solution at which the dynamical system stays constant, thus, the derivative of the solution must be zero. Here is the formal definition:</p>

<p>For an ordinary differential equation <span class="math inline">\(\dot x = f(x)\)</span>, a point <span class="math inline">\(x^*\)</span> which satisfies <span class="math inline">\(f(x^*)=0\)</span> is called a <em>fixed point</em> or <em>equilibrium</em>, and the solution with the initial condition <span class="math inline">\(x(0)=x^*\)</span> is constant over time <span class="math inline">\(x(t)=x^*\)</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Example.</strong> The linear equation <span class="math inline">\(\dot x = rx\)</span> has a single fixed point at <span class="math inline">\(x^* = 0\)</span>. For a more interesting example, consider a logistic equation: <span class="math inline">\(\dot x = x - x^2\)</span>. Its fixed points are the solutions of <span class="math inline">\(x - x^2 = 0\)</span>, therefore there two fixed points: <span class="math inline">\(x^* = 0, 1\)</span>. We know that if the solution has either of the fixed points as the initial condition, it will remain at that value for all time.</p>
<p>Locating the fixed points is not sufficient to predict the global behavior of the dynamical system, however. What happens to the solution of a dynamical system if the initial condition is very close to an equilibrium, but not precisely at it? Put another way, what happens if the equilibrium is perturbed? The solution may be attracted to the equilibrium value, that is, it approaches it ever-closer, or else it is not. In the first case, this is called a stable equilibrium, because a small perturbation does not dramatically change the long-term behavior of the solution. In the latter case, the equilibrium is called unstable, and the solution perturbed from the equilibrium never returns. These concepts are formalized in the following definition</p>

<p>To determine whether a fixed point is stable analytically we use the approach called <em>linearization</em>, which involves replacing the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> with a linear approximation. Let us define <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon(t)\)</span> to be the deviation of the solution <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> from the fixed point <span class="math inline">\(x^*\)</span>, so we can write <span class="math inline">\(x(t) = x^* + \epsilon(t)\)</span>. Assuming that <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon(t)\)</span> is small, we can write the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> using Taylor’s formula: <span class="math display">\[ f(x^*+\epsilon(t))= f(x^*)+f'(x^*) \epsilon(t) + ... = f'(x^*) \epsilon(t) + ... \]</span></p>
<p>The term <span class="math inline">\(f(x^*)\)</span> vanished because it is zero by definition <span class="math inline">\(\ref{def:ch16_fixedpt}\)</span> of a fixed point. The ellipsis indicates all the terms of order <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon(t)^2\)</span> and higher, which are very small if <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon(t)\)</span> is small, and thus can be neglected. Thus, we can write the following approximation to the ODE <span class="math inline">\(\dot x = f(x)\)</span> near a fixed point:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \dot x =  \frac{d(x^* + \epsilon(t))}{dt} = \dot \epsilon(t) =  f'(x^*) \epsilon(t)\]</span></p>
<p>Thus we replaced the complicated nonlinear ODE near a fixed point with a linear equation, which approximates the dynamics of the deviation <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon(t)\)</span> near the fixed point <span class="math inline">\(x^*\)</span>; note that the derivative <span class="math inline">\(f'(x^*)\)</span> is a constant for any given fixed point. In section <span class="math inline">\(\ref{sec:math15}\)</span> we classified the behavior of solutions for the general linear ODE <span class="math inline">\(\dot x = rx\)</span>, and now we apply this classification to the behavior of the deviation <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon(t)\)</span>. If the multiple <span class="math inline">\(f'(x^*)\)</span> is positive, the deviation <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon(t)\)</span> is growing, the solution is diverging away from the fixed point, and thus the fixed point is unstable. If the multiple <span class="math inline">\(f'(x^*)\)</span> is negative, the deviation <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon(t)\)</span> is decaying, the solution is converging to the fixed point, and thus the fixed point is stable. Finally, there is the borderline case of <span class="math inline">\(f'(x^*) = 0\)</span> which is inconclusive, and the fixed point may be either stable or unstable. The derivative stability analysis is summarized in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f'(x^*) &gt; 0\)</span>: the slope of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> at the fixed point is positive, then the fixed point is .</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f'(x^*) &lt; 0\)</span>: the slope of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> at the fixed point is negative, then the fixed point is .</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f'(x^*) = 0\)</span>: stability cannot be determined from the derivative.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, knowing the derivative or the slope of the defining function at the fixed point is enough to know its stability. If the derivative has the discourtesy of being zero, the situation is tricky, because then higher order terms that we neglected make the difference. We will mostly avoid such borderline cases, but they are important in some applications .</p>
<p><strong>A word of caution:</strong> The derivative of the defining function <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> is not the second derivative of the solution <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span>. This is a common mistake, because the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is equal to the time derivative of <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span>. However, the derivative <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> is not with respect to time, it is with respect to x, the dependent variable. In other words, it reflects the slope of the graph of the defining function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, not the curvature of the graph of the solution <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>To summarize, here is an outline of the steps for analyzing the behavior of solutions of an autonomous one-variable ODE. These tasks can be accomplished either by plotting the defining function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> and finding the fixed points and their stability based on the plot, or by solving for the fixed points on paper, then finding the derivative <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> and plugging in the values of the fixed points to determine their stability. Either approach is valid, but the analytic methods are necessary when dealing with models that have unknown parameter values, which makes it impossible to represent the defining function in a plot.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Example: linear model.</strong> Consider the linear ODE that we analyzed above <span class="math inline">\(dx/dt = 4x -100\)</span>. Let us go through the steps of qualitative analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>find the fixed points by setting the defining function to 0: <span class="math inline">\(0 = 4x -100\)</span>, so there is only one fixed point <span class="math inline">\(x^* = 25\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>divide the domain of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> into intervals separated by fixed points <span class="math inline">\(x^*\)</span>: the intervals are <span class="math inline">\(x&lt;25\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x&gt;25\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>the solution is decreasing on the interval <span class="math inline">\(x&lt;25\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(f(x)&lt;0\)</span> there, and the solution is increasing on the interval <span class="math inline">\(x&gt;25\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(f(x)&gt;0\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>the derivative <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> at the fixed point is 4, so the fixed point is <em>unstable</em></p></li>
<li><p>solutions <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> starting at different initial values are shown in figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:ch16_flow_linear}\)</span>b and they behave as follows: solutions with initial values below <span class="math inline">\(x^*=25\)</span> decreasing, and those with initial values above <span class="math inline">\(x^*=25\)</span> increasing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>** Example: logistic model.** Consider the logistic model from the previous subsection, <span class="math inline">\(dP/dt =0.3P(1-P/40)\)</span>. We have analyzed the stability of the two fixed points using the plot in figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:ch16_flow_logistic}\)</span>, and saw that the flow takes the solution away from <span class="math inline">\(P=0\)</span>, and toward <span class="math inline">\(P=K\)</span>, thus the first fixed point is unstable, while the second is stable. Let us repeat the analysis using analytic tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>find the fixed points by setting the defining function to 0: <span class="math inline">\(0 = 0.3P(1-P/40)\)</span>. The two solutions are <span class="math inline">\(P^*=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P^*=40\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>divide the domain of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> into intervals separated by fixed points <span class="math inline">\(P^*\)</span>: the intervals are <span class="math inline">\(P&lt;0\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(0&lt;P&lt;40\)</span>; and <span class="math inline">\(P&gt;40\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>the solution is decreasing on the interval <span class="math inline">\(P&lt;0\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(f(P)&lt;0\)</span> there, the solution is increasing on the interval <span class="math inline">\(0&lt;P&lt;40\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(f(P)&gt;0\)</span>, and the solution is decreasing for <span class="math inline">\(P&gt;40\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(f(P)&lt;0\)</span> there</p></li>
<li><p>the derivative is <span class="math inline">\(f'(P)=0.3-0.3P/20\)</span>; since <span class="math inline">\(f'(0)=0.3 &gt; 0\)</span>, the fixed point is <em>unstable</em>; since <span class="math inline">\(P'(40)=-0.3&lt;0\)</span>, the fixed point is <em>stable</em></p></li>
<li><p>solutions <span class="math inline">\(P(t)\)</span> starting at different initial values are shown in figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:ch16_flow_logistic}\)</span>b and they behave as follows: solutions with initial values below <span class="math inline">\(P^*=0\)</span> decreasing, those with initial values between 0 and 40 are increasing and asymptotically approaching 40, and those with initial values above 40 decreasing and asymptotically approaching 40.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This can be done more generally using the derivative test: taking the derivative of the function on the right-hand-side (with respect to <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>), we get <span class="math inline">\(f'(P) = r(1-2\frac{P}{K})\)</span>. Assuming <span class="math inline">\(r&gt;0\)</span> (the population is viable), <span class="math inline">\(f'(0)= r\)</span> is positive, and the fixed point is therefore unstable. This makes biological sense, since we assumed positive inherent population growth, so given a few individuals, it will increase in size. On the other hand, <span class="math inline">\(P'(K) = r(1-2) = -r\)</span>, so this fixed point is stable. Thus, according to the logistic model, a population with a positive inherent growth rate will not grow unchecked, like in the exponential model, but will increase until it reaches its carrying capacity, at which it will stay (if all parameters remain constant).</p>
<p><strong>Example: semi-stable fixed point.</strong> Consider the ODE <span class="math inline">\(dx/dt = -x^3 + x^2\)</span>, whose defining function is plotted in figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:ch16_flow_semi}\)</span>a, showing two fixed points at <span class="math inline">\(x = 0, 1\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>find the fixed points by setting the defining function to 0: <span class="math inline">\(0 = -x^3 + x^2\)</span>. The two fixed points are <span class="math inline">\(x^*=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x^*=1\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>divide the domain of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> into intervals separated by fixed points <span class="math inline">\(x^*\)</span>: the intervals are <span class="math inline">\(x&lt;0\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(0&lt;x&lt;1\)</span>; and <span class="math inline">\(x&gt;1\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>the solution is increasing on the interval <span class="math inline">\(x&lt;0\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(f(x)&gt;0\)</span> there, the solution is increasing on the interval <span class="math inline">\(0&lt;x&lt;1\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(f(x)&gt;0\)</span>, and the solution is decreasing for <span class="math inline">\(x&gt;1\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(f(x)&lt;0\)</span> there</p></li>
<li><p>the derivative is <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)=-3x^2+2x\)</span>; since <span class="math inline">\(f'(0)=0\)</span>, the fixed point is <em>undetermined</em>; since <span class="math inline">\(f'(1)=-1&lt;0\)</span>, the fixed point is <em>stable</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>the solutions <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> starting at different initial values are shown in figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:ch16_flow_semi}\)</span>b, and they behave as follows: solutions with initial values below 0 are increasing and asymptotically approaching 0, those with initial values between 0 and 1 are increasing and asymptotically approaching 1, and those with initial values above 1 are decreasing and asymptotically approaching 1.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This example shows how graphical analysis can help when derivative analysis is undetermined. The red arrows on the x-axis of figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:ch16_flow_semi}\)</span> show the direction of the flow in the three different regions separated by the fixed points. Flow is to the right for <span class="math inline">\(x&lt;1\)</span>, to the left for for <span class="math inline">\(x&gt;1\)</span>; it is clear that the arrows approach the fixed point from both sides, and thus the fixed point is stable, as the negative slope of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span> indicates. One the other hand, the fixed point at <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> presents a more complicated situation: the slope of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is zero, and the flow is rightward on both sides of the fixed point. This type of fixed point is sometimes called <em>semi-stable</em>, because it is stable when approached from one side, and unstable when approached from the other.</p>

<p>Like most programming languages, R allows one to define and use structures called functions. Some are already written and loaded into the R distribution, for example, the function <code>mean()</code> we use to compute the mean of a vector variable, while others can be defined by users. Functions are discrete chunks of code that can be <em>called</em> from the outside to perform some task. The function receives inputs from the call and returns the result back. Here is the general structure of a function in R:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>myfunction <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="cf">function</span>(arg1, arg2, ...) {</span>

</div>
<p>A function is a piece of code that is <strong>defined</strong> separately and can be <strong>called</strong> by other pieces of code. The main purpose is to create a “black box” that does a specific job and can be used repeatedly just by calling the function (invoking its name), rather than copying the code repeatedly.</p>
<p>A function generally has input variables (although sometimes there are none) and returns an output using the <code>return()</code> statement. It is important to distinguish between the <em>inside</em> of the function - the code between the curly braces in the function definition - and the <em>outside</em>, that is everything else. The inputs are <em>passed</em> to the function in the call (through the parentheses) and then used inside the function to do its business and produce an output, which is then <em>returned</em> back to the place in the code where the function was called.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a function definition, with input variables N and r. Between the curly braces is the <em>body of the function</em>, which in this case multiplies the two input variables and then returns them.</p>

<p>After a function is defined, it is ready to be called (executed) by invoking its name and giving the correct number of inputs. Here’s an example of a function call:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>a <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="dv">30</span></span>

</div>
<p>Notice that the variable names in the fuction call do not have to be same as what they are called within the function. IMPORTANT: a function uses the order of variables in the function call, called <em>external variables</em> (<code>y</code>, <code>a</code>) to assign their names within the function, called <em>internal variables</em> (<code>N</code>, <code>r</code>). (There is a way to specify which input belongs to which internal variable, e.g.&nbsp;<code>plot(x=time, y=sol)</code> and in that case the order is not important.)</p>

<p></p>
<p>The field of <em>epidemiology</em> studies the distribution of disease and health states in populations. Epidemiologists describe and model these issues with the goal of helping public health workers devise interventions to improve the overall health outcomes on a large scale. One particular topic of interest is the the spread of infectious disease and how best tor respond to it.. Because epidemiology is concerned with large numbers of people, the models used in the field do not address the details of an individual disease history. One approach to modeling this is to put people into categories, such as <em>susceptible</em> (those who can be infected but are not), <em>infectious</em> (those who are infected and can spread the disease), and <em>recovered</em> (those who cannot be infected or spread disease). This type of models is called a <em>compartment model</em> and they are they commonly used to represent infectious disease on a population level both for deterministic models (e.g.&nbsp;ODEs) and stochastic models (e.g.&nbsp;Markov models). Dividing people into categories involves the assumption that everyone in a particular category behaves in the same manner: for instance, all susceptible people are infected with the same rate and all infected people recover with the same rate.</p>
<p>Let us construct an ODE to describe a two-compartment epidemiology model. There are two dependent variables to be tracked: the number of susceptible (<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>) and infected (<span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>) individuals in the population. The susceptible individuals can get infected, while the infected ones can recover and become susceptible again. The implicit assumption is that there is no immunity, and recovered individuals can get infected with the same ease as those who were never infected. There are some human diseases for which this is true, for instance the common cold or gonorrhea. Transitions between the different classes of individuals can be summarized by the following scheme: <span class="math display">\[ S + I \xrightarrow{\beta} I \xrightarrow{\gamma} S \]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is the individual rate of infection, also known as the transmission rate, and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is the individual rate of recovery. There is an important distinction between the processes of infection and recovery: the former requires an infected individual and a susceptible individual, while the latter needs only an infected individual. Therefore, it is reasonable to suppose that the rate of growth of infected individuals is the product of the individual transmission rate <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and the product of the number of infected and susceptible individuals. The overall rate of recovery is the individual recovery rate <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> multiplied by the number of the infected. This leads to the following two differential equations: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray*}
\dot S &amp;=&amp; -\beta IS + \gamma I \\
\dot I &amp; = &amp;\beta I S - \gamma I
\end{eqnarray*}\]</span> Note that, as in the chemical kinetics models, the two equations add up to zero on the right hand side, leading to the conclusion that <span class="math inline">\(\dot S + \dot I = 0\)</span>. Therefore, the total number of people is a conserved quantity <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, which does not change. This makes sense since we did not consider any births or deaths in the ODE model, only transitions between susceptible and infected individuals.</p>
<p>We can use the conserved quantity <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> to reduce the two equations to one, by the substitution of <span class="math inline">\(S = N -I\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[  \dot I  =  \beta I (N - I) - \gamma I \]</span> This model may be analyzed using qualitative methods that were developed in this chapter, allowing prediction of the dynamics of the fraction of infected for different transmission and recovery rates. First, let us find the fixed points of the differential equation. Setting the equation to zero, we find: <span class="math display">\[ 0  =  \beta I (N - I) - \gamma I \Rightarrow I^* = 0; \; I^* =  N - \gamma/\beta \]</span> This means that there are two equilibrium levels of infection: either nobody is infected (<span class="math inline">\(I^* = 0\)</span>) or there is some persistent number of infected individuals ($ I^* = N - /$). Notice that the second fixed point is only biologically relevant if $N &gt; /$.</p>
<p>Use the derivative test to check for stability. First, find the general expression for derivative of the defining function: $f’(I) = -2 I + N - $. \begin{figure}[htbp] % figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page</p>

<p>The stability of the fixed point <span class="math inline">\(I^* = 0\)</span> is found by plugging in this value into the derivative formula: $f’(0) = N - $. We learned in section <span class="math inline">\(\ref{sec:math16}\)</span> that a fixed point is stable if the derivative of the defining function is negative. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(I^* = 0\)</span> is stable if <span class="math inline">\(\gamma - \beta N &gt; 0\)</span>, and unstable otherwise. This gives us a <em>stability condition</em> on the values of the biological parameters. If the recovery rate <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is greater than the rate of infection for the population (the transmission rate multiplied by the population size) <span class="math inline">\(\beta N\)</span>, then the no-infection equilibrium is stable. This predicts that the infection dies out if the recovery rate is faster than the rate of infection, which makes biological sense.</p>
<p>Similarly, we find the stability of the second fixed point <span class="math inline">\(I^* = N - \gamma/\beta\)</span> by substituting its value into the derivative, to obtain <span class="math inline">\(f'(N - \gamma/\beta) = \gamma - \beta N\)</span>. By the same logic, as above, this fixed point is stable if <span class="math inline">\(\gamma - \beta N &lt; 0\)</span>, or if <span class="math inline">\(\gamma &lt; \beta N\)</span>. This is a complementary condition for the fixed point at 0, that is, only one fixed point can be stable for any given parameter values. In the biological interpretation, if the transmission rate <span class="math inline">\(\beta N\)</span> is greater than the recovery rate <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, then the epidemic will persist.</p>
<p>We can use our graphical analysis skills to illustrate the situation. Consider a situation in which <span class="math inline">\(\gamma &lt; \beta N\)</span>. As predicted by stability analysis, the zero infection equilibrium should be unstable, and the equilibrium at <span class="math inline">\(N - \gamma/\beta\)</span> should be stable. In order to plot the function $f(I) = I (N - I) - I $, we choose the specific parameter values <span class="math inline">\(N=1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = 0.1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta = 0.2\)</span>; setting <span class="math inline">\(N=1\)</span> means <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> represent the fraction of the population in the susceptible and infected categories. Figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:ch16_flow_sis1}\)</span>a shows the direction of the flow on the <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>-axis prescribed by the defining function <span class="math inline">\(f(I)\)</span> with red arrows. It is clear that solutions approach the fixed point at <span class="math inline">\(N - \gamma/\beta\)</span> from both directions, which make it a stable fixed point, while diverging from <span class="math inline">\(I=0\)</span>, as shown in figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:ch16_flow_sis1}\)</span>b.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if <span class="math inline">\(\gamma &gt; \beta N\)</span>, stability analysis predicts that the no-infection equilibrium (<span class="math inline">\(I=0\)</span>) is stable. Figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:ch16_flow_sis2}\)</span>a shows the plot of the defining function for the parameter values <span class="math inline">\(N=1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = 0.3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta = 0.2\)</span>. The flow on the <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>-axis is toward the zero equilibrium, therefore it is stable. Note that the second equilibrium at <span class="math inline">\(I^* = N - \gamma/\beta\)</span> is negative, and thus has no biological significance. The solutions, if the initial value is positive, all approach 0, so the infection inevitably dies out.</p>
<p>Mathematical modeling of epidemiology has been a success story in the last few decades. Public health workers routinely estimate the parameter called the <em>basic reproductive number</em> <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> defined to be the average number of new infections caused by a single infected individual in a susceptible population. This number comes out of our analysis above, where we found <span class="math inline">\(R_0 = N \beta/\gamma\)</span> to determine whether or not an epidemic persisted . This number is critical in more sophisticated models of epidemiology.</p>
<p>Mathematical models are used to predict the time course of an epidemic, called the <em>epidemic curve</em> and then advise on the public health interventions that can reduce the number of affected individuals. In reality, most epidemic curves have the shape similar to the data from the Ebola virus epidemic in figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:ch16-ebola}\)</span>. Most such curves show an initial increase in infections, peaking, and the declining to low levels, which is fundamentally different than the solution curves we obtained from the two-compartment model. To describe dynamics of this nature, models with more than two variables are needed, such as classic three-compartment SIR models (susceptible-infected-recovered) models and their modifications . Being able to predict the future of an epidemic based on <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> and other parameters allows public health officials to prepare and deploy interventions (vaccinations, quarantine, etc.) that have the best shot at minimizing the epidemic.</p>
